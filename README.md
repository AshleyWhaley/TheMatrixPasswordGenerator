# TheMatrixPasswordGenerator
*A useful password generator using JavaScript*

## Motivation
Everything requests a password today. I bet your average person uses their tried and true go-to password for 99% of their logins. With hacking on the rise, why not use a completely random and also completely forgettable password! Here is my excellent random password generator. I can almost guarantee no hacker will figure this bad boy out. Also on the bright side you will never remember it so you will have to come back for another awesome random password!

## Who should make it?
This code is available for anyone interested in confusing any hacker and any user. :smiley: I recommend this to any company who has inferior security and user with superior memory.
